# Prelaunch (for dsi.cfw.guide)

# It's better to use dsi.cfw.guide, as it's updated as soon as there is a change and is quite simple to follow. Get started from [here](https://dsi.cfw.guide/get-started.html)

Prelaunch's purpose is just "for it to be". It's not intended for use in some kind of guide or of a large amount of people.

As of now, Prelaunch was tested only on Windows 10. It is unknown if the same code will work on other OS (macOS, Linux etc.).

This program automatically downloads 
- Memory Pit
- TWiLight Menu++
- dumpTool
- Unlaunch
and places them in the correct folders on the SD card ready for use with the [dsi.cfw.guide](https://dsi.cfw.guide/).

## Requirements:
- An SD card

### Windows

- Windows 7+ needed to run the executable

### macOS

- macOS 10.14+ (Mojave) needed to run the executable

### Python3 (Linux, macOS, Windows)

- At least Python 3.5 with the Tkinter library
